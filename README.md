# Introduction (Fruits Recognition)
Computer vision methods and strategies can help to recognize the fruits with some basic features like the color of fruits, intensity of fruits ,shape of fruits and texture of the fruits. The term "recognize" is to predict the name of the fruit. In this project, we are going to use 81 different fruits claases. We will train the model using tensorflow.


# Problem description:
To build a robust system to recognize the fruits according to the color of fruits, intensity of fruits ,shape of fruits and texture of the fruits.
Evolution measures:
After training the model, we will apply the evaluation measures to check that how the model is getting predictions. We will use the following evaluation measures to evaluate the performance of the model:
- Accuracy
- Plots of training and validation scores

# Technical Approach
We are using python language in the implementations and Jupyter Notebook that support the machine learning and data science projects. We will build tensorflow based model. We will use Fruits360 dataset. The dataset providers provide the training and test data separately. After training on the model, we will evaluate the model to check the performance of trained model.
