# Introduction (Fruits Recognition)
Computer vision methods and strategies can help to recognize the fruits with some basic features like the color of fruits, intensity of fruits ,shape of fruits and texture of the fruits. The term "recognize" is to predict the name of the fruit. In this project, we used 81 different fruits claases. We  trained the model using tensorflow. The model trained model convolutional neural network and got 99% accuracy. 


# Problem description:
To build a robust system to recognize the fruits according to the color of fruits, intensity of fruits ,shape of fruits and texture of the fruits.
Evolution measures:
After training the model, we applied the evaluation measures to check that how the model is getting predictions. We used the following evaluation measures to evaluate the performance of the model:
- Accuracy
- Plots of training and validation scores

# Technical Approach
We used python language in the implementations and Jupyter Notebook that support the machine learning and data science projects. We built tensorflow based model. We have used Fruits360 dataset. The dataset providers provide the training and test data separately. After training on the model, we evaluated the model to check the performance of trained model.
